# Niyantri Coffee - Website Package

This is a complete 5-page static website for a NiYANTRI-inspired coffee shop named "Niyantri Coffee". It uses a coffee-color themed design, Tailwind CSS for styling, and a PayPal sandbox integration for the cart checkout.

Pages:
- index.html — Home with full-screen hero, quotes, and navigation
- menu.html — Default menu items with Add to Cart functionality
- cart.html — Cart with PayPal checkout (sandbox)
- about.html — About the brand and roasts
- contact.html — Contact form and location (Hyderabad, India placeholder)

Notes:
- Font pairing uses two Google Fonts: Playfair Display (serif) and Inter (sans).
- All interactive elements include Tailwind transition classes such as transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out with hover effects.
- Page load fades in using a small script and body class adjustments.
- The main content uses full-width, fluid layouts (no fixed max-width containers).
- Images are placeholders using the required placeholder syntax.
- Footer includes the current year: 2025.

How to run:
- Open the HTML files directly in a browser from the generated folder.
- The PayPal integration uses a placeholder client-id: YOUR_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID. Replace it with a real sandbox client-id to test payments.
